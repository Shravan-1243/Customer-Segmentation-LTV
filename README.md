# Customer Segmentation & LTV Analysis
This project aims to segment e-commerce customers based on their purchasing behavior and estimate their lifetime value (LTV) to enable targeted marketing strategies and improve business profitability.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is available on Kaggle:  
[Online Retail E-Commerce Data](https://kaggle.com/datasets/1fdb257f95302f345850b066d9587aed8b19ad653217ababb3af21aca25a76de)
It includes online transactional data for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail company.

## Project Overview
- Customer Segmentation using **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)** & K-Means
- **Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)** Prediction using **Random Forest**
- Segment-wise **Profitability** and **Revenue Analysis**
- Feature Importance from ML Models
- Data Visualization & Actionable Insights

 Business Use Case:
- Identify loyal/high-value customers for loyalty rewards

- Spot inactive customers for re-engagement campaigns

- Allocate marketing budget effectively

- Predict future customer value for strategic planning
---
## Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
  - Removed missing values, invalid entries, and canceled transactions
  - Parsed and filtered for valid `CustomerID`, `Invoice`, `InvoiceDate`, `TotalPrice`

2. **RFM Feature Engineering**
  - **Recency**: Days since last purchase
  - **Frequency**: Number of unique invoices
  - **Monetary**: Total spend per customer

3. **RFM Scoring**
   - Each customer scored on a scale from 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest)
   - Combined into an `RFM_Score`

4. **K-Means Clustering**
   - Elbow method used to identify optimal K (K = 4)
   - Customers grouped into 4 clusters

5. **Customer LTV Estimation using Random Forest**
- Trained a Random Forest Regressor model on RFM + Cluster features
- Evaluated using RMSE, MAE, and RÂ² score (RÂ² â‰ˆ 0.9864 indicates high accuracy)
- Extracted Feature Importance to identify key drivers (Monetary, Cluster)

6. **LTV Segmentation & Revenue Analysis**
- Divided predicted LTV into 4 quantiles: Low, Medium, High, Very High
- Analyzed customer count and total revenue by LTV segments
- Cross-tabbed LTV segments with customer clusters (heatmap)

7. **Profitability Segmentation**
   - Segments analyzed based on LTV and total profit contribution

8. **Data Visualization**
   - Histograms, Boxplots, and Scatter Plots used to explore segment patterns

## Key Results
**Top 20% of customers contribute to 80%+ of revenue**
- **4 Customer Clusters** identified:
  - High-value, loyal customers
  - New or inactive customers
  - Mid-tier profitable customers
  - Low-spending customers
- Very High LTV customers contribute the majority of total revenue
- Monetary value and Cluster ID were the most influential features in LTV prediction
- Cluster 0 had a significant number of Very High LTV customers
- LTV segmentation enabled clear revenue attribution and customer prioritization

- **LTV Distribution**:
  - Wide gap in lifetime value across clusters
  - Top 20% of customers contribute to 80%+ of revenue
---
## Tools & Technologies

- Python (RandomForestRegressor from sklearn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- Seaborn/Matplotlib for plotting LTV visualizations
- Kaggle Notebook
- GitHub for version control & project sharing
---
## Insights & Applications

- Helps in **targeted marketing** and **loyalty programs**
- Provides clarity on **which customers drive revenue**
- Supports decisions on **where to focus promotional efforts**
- Enables data-driven **retention strategies**
